  title: "About me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I&apos;m a Senior Technical Writer with over 10 years of technical expertise, currently working on a product team that employs an Agile methodology. In this role, I work with engineering, product, and support to produce high-quality software documentation for new and existing features. I specialize in developer documentation, with skills in docs-as-code workflows, static site generators, and Git-based version control.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    We use a documentation approach that keeps me learning while allowing me to sharpen frontend skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I enjoy the technical aspects of my work, working with REST APIs and SDKs, collaborating with engineers, and participating in the software development lifecycle. To produce software documentation, I prefer a docs-as-code approach and working with static site generators such as Hugo, Jekyll, or Gatsby. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In past roles, I&apos;ve led documentation efforts and also served as a member of quality assurance (QA) teams, where I often tested system features before writing about them. Additionally, I have experience in scripting and editing video tutorials.

    When I can step through a task, test it, and write about it. Going through each step helps my understanding and improves the documentation results.
