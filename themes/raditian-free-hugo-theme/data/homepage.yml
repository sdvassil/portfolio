  title: "About me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I&apos;m a technical writer on a software development team that employs an agile methodology. In this role, I work with support, engineers, and the Product team to produce and review software documentation that highlights new and existing features.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    We use a docs-as-code approach that keeps me learning, while giving me the chance to sharpen frontend skills, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy the technical aspects of my work, being close to engineers, and participating in the development process. In the future, I hope to have the opportunity to work on API documentation.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In past roles, I have led documentation efforts and also served as a member of a Quality Assurance (QA) team, where I often tested system features before writing about them. Additionally, I have experience scripting and editing video tutorials.

    When I can step through a task, test it, and write about it. Going through each step helps my understanding and improves the documentation results.

    '<p class="lead">
    My undergraduate studies prepared me for a journalism career as a news writer, video editor, live truck operator, and videographer. After some years in the broadcasting world, I switched gears and received my Master of Applied Science in Information and Communications Technology, with a concentration in web design and development. I feel that my experience in both of these areas contributes to my effectiveness as a communicator and documentarian.
