  title: "About me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I&apos;m a Technical Writer on a Product team that employs an agile methodology. In this role, I work with support and engineers to produce and review software documentation for new and existing features.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    We use a documentation approach that keeps me learning while allowing me to sharpen frontend skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I enjoy the technical aspects of my work, working with our REST APIs, being close to engineers, and participating in the development process.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    To produce software documentation, I prefer a docs-as-code philosophy and working with static site generators such as Hugo. In past roles, I have led documentation efforts and also served as a member of a Quality Assurance (QA) team, where I often tested system features before writing about them. Additionally, I have experience scripting and editing video tutorials.
    </p>'
  subtitle:
    '<p class="blockquote-text">
    When I can step through a task, test it, and write about it. Going through each step helps my understanding and improves the documentation results.
    </p>'

    '<p class="lead">
    My undergraduate studies prepared me for a journalism career as a news writer, video editor, live truck operator, and videographer. After some years in the broadcasting world, I switched gears and received my Master of Applied Science in Information and Communications Technology, with a concentration in Web Design and Development. I feel that my experience in both of these areas contributes to my effectiveness as a communicator and documentarian.
